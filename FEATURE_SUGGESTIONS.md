# Feature Suggestions for "Fun with Words"

## Daily Puzzle Enhancements
- **Streak tracking dashboard** – show current and best win streaks, with visual indicators when a new streak milestone is hit.
- **Difficulty toggles** – allow players to opt into "hard mode" rules (locked letters, limited guesses) or a relaxed mode with extra attempts.
- **Mini-hints system** – let players spend optional hints earned from streaks; hints could reveal a random letter or indicate if the solution contains rare characters.

## Game Modes
- **Timed blitz mode** – players race against a countdown clock with shorter entry windows and bonus points for quick solves.
- **Daily challenge variations** – introduce themed words on certain days (e.g., science Sunday, movie Monday) to keep the vocabulary fresh.
- **Practice sandbox** – unlimited guesses using archival words to help new players learn without affecting streaks.

## Social & Community
- **Shareable results cards** – export results with emoji grids tailored to match the app's branding for quick sharing on social platforms.
- **Friends leaderboard** – private leaderboards that update daily, optionally tied to login providers for easy friend discovery.
- **Community word submissions** – moderated form where fans can propose words for future puzzles, with credit when selected.

## Progression & Rewards
- **Badge system** – unlock achievements for feats like solving with zero hints, completing themed days, or maintaining long streaks.
- **Seasonal events** – limited-time quests (e.g., solve 10 autumn-themed words) with exclusive badges or color palettes as rewards.
- **In-game currency** – earn tokens from daily play to spend on hints, cosmetic tile themes, or celebratory animations.

## Accessibility & UX
- **High-contrast and color-blind palettes** – alternate tile and keyboard color schemes to improve readability for all players.
- **Keyboard navigation improvements** – ensure full support for screen readers and add ARIA live regions for toast notifications.

## Analytics & Administration
